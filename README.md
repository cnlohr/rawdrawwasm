# rawdrawwasm

My stab at rawdraw on wasm.  This is based on:
 https://github.com/zNoctum/wasm-tool
and has inspiration from:
 https://github.com/cnlohr/wasm_integrated

Lots of stuff todo, hopefully this will get rolled into main rawdraw.

TODO notes for now:
 * hook up button presses, and mouse input and destroy
 * hook up sleep in a more meaningful way maybe?
 * Make printf work.
 * Make libc work.
 * Figure out how to #include math.h
 * Come up with guide on how to use this.

Check it out, live: https://cnlohr.github.io/rawdrawwasm/
